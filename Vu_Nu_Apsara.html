      <h2>A Glimpse into Cham Aesthetics</h2>
      <p>
        The Apsara Dancer Statue (Tượng vũ nữ Apsara) captures the elegance and poise of celestial dancers found in Hindu and Cham mythology. 
        This sandstone sculpture reflects the influence of both spiritual and courtly ideals, combining graceful motion with meditative serenity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Carved during the 10th century, it demonstrates the Cham artists' deep appreciation for rhythm, beauty, and symbolic storytelling. 
        Apsaras were believed to dance in the heavens, entertaining gods and embodying divine grace.

      <h2>Symbolism and Craft</h2>
      <p>
        The dancer's fluid posture and ornate jewelry speak volumes about Cham craftsmanship. 
        Notice the curved hip, extended arms, and hair arranged in a traditional bun — each feature imbued with ritual significance and balance.
      </p>
      <p>
        This statue likely adorned a temple wall, celebrating divine femininity and the harmony between art, dance, and worship.

      <h2>Legacy and Cultural Value</h2>
      <p>
        As one of the finest surviving Cham sculptures of a female figure, the Apsara Dancer offers rare insight into premodern Vietnamese art. 
        It bridges sacred myth and material form, making it a vital piece of cultural heritage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, it stands not only as a work of art but also as a symbol of Champa's refined worldview — where dance, devotion, and divinity flowed as one.
